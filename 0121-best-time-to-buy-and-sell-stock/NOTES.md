### test cases
1. [7 1 2  5 3 6 3]
2. [7 6 4 3 3 2 ]
3. [1 2 4 4 5 5]
4. [1 2]
5. [2 1]
​
#### obsevations
- cannot sort ->
- similar to 2 pointer approach but cannot sort
- proabably sliding window
- always move in 1 direction - sliding window or precomputation
​
### best approach - sliding window
- move
