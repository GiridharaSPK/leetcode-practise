- binary search - every single +1 or -1, <=, <, >, >= is important
- always try to reduce search space by half
- update boundaries every time i.e. start and end or high or low
- when updating boundaries think if mid can be answer or not thoroughly
- (mid should get updated automatically every iteration)


// test cases
- 1 element 2 element arrays
- single rotation
- n-1 rotations
- mid rotations - min is exactly at mid or pivot is at mid
- all equal elements or duplicate elements
