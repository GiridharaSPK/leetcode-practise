- binary search - every single +1 or -1, <=, <, >, >= is important
- always try to reduce search space by half
- update boundaries every time i.e. start and end or high or low
- when updating boundaries think if mid can be answer or not thoroughly
- (mid should get updated automatically every iteration)


// test cases
1 - 1 element 2 element arrays
2 - single rotation
3 - n-1 rotations
4 - mid rotations - min is exactly at mid or pivot is at mid
5 - all equal elements or duplicate elements
