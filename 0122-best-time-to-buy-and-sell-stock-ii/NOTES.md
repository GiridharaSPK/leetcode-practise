1. when it looks like multiple solutions possible - not always recursion/ DP
2. test for a few cases (neetcode)
	- if there is a fixed pattern in solution  - avoid recursion/DP
	- here every possible upslope can be added to profit
	- so no dp is required


3. Solved approaches of striver at the bottom
     - version of recusion+memoization (TLE) and DP (working)
