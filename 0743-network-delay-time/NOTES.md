- Dijkstras uses **BFS** (difficult to track traversed distance with DFS)
- BFS + Priority Queue (instead of queue) -> min heap to retrive nearest node from a given node (dist, val)
-
- Time Complexity - **(V+E) log V **->
â€‹
- convert to adj list : a -> (w, b), ...
- add first element to heap - 0,k (0-distance of k to k, k node)
- iterate over heap until heap gets emptied(not until visted count == n because to find shortest path, we need to traverse all nodes)
- traverse using bfs - easy to estimate updated path distance
- to traverse to next nodes, when getting adj lists, makesure there are adj nodes (add contains check for map.get(node))
- when next nodes are added to heap, update the dist = dist + currentDist (to keep track of traversed distances)
-- heap.push(dist+currDistance, val)
- edge case - check visited set size - if all the components of graph are not connected, the ans is **-1**
